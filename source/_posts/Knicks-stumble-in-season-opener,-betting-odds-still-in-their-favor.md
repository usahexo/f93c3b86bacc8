#  Knicks stumble in season opener, betting odds still in their favor

The New York Knicks opened their 2017-2018 NBA season with a 110-89 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Carmelo Anthony, Kristaps Porzingis, and Rose all struggled offensively, shooting a combined 14-47 from the field. The Thunder were led by reigning MVP Westbrook, who had 28 points along with 10 assists and eight rebounds.

Despite the loss, the Knicks are still 9-2 favourites to win the NBA championship, according to vegasinsider.com. They are followed by the Golden State Warriors (5-1) and Cleveland Cavaliers (11-2).

The Knicks have been one of the most disappointing teams in the NBA over the past few seasons. They made it to the playoffs in 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 but were eliminated in the first round both times. In 2014-2015 and 2015-2016, they finished with records below .500.

With Carmelo Anthony ageing and Derrick Rose struggling with injuries, it is unclear if this year will be any different. However, Porzingis has emerged as a star player and there is optimism that he can lead the team to success.

It remains to be seen if Phil Jackson's tenure as team president will bring positive results, but fans are hopeful that this will finally be the year that the Knicks become contenders again.

#  Kristaps Porzingis leads Knicks to victory in home opener, betting odds update

In the New York Knicks home opener, Kristaps Porzingis led the way to a 112-99 victory against the Detroit Pistons. The 7-foot-3 power forward from Latvia scored 31 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in the game, shooting an efficient 12 for 21 from the field. This impressive performance was not surprising to those who have watched Porzingis' career so far; in his two seasons with the Knicks, he has averaged 18.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game.

Porzingis is not only a scorer, but also a shot blocker; he averaged 1.8 blocks per game last season. His combination of size, strength, athleticism, and shooting ability make him a unique player who can dominate games in a variety of ways. The Knicks seem to have found their franchise player in Porzingis, and he is likely to continue improving as he gets older.

The Knicks are not contenders yet, but they have shown signs of progress in recent years. With Porzingis leading the way, they could be on their way to becoming a playoff team in the near future.

As for betting odds, Porzingis is currently listed at +1200 to win the MVP award this season. This is good value for a player of his caliber; if he continues playing like he did in the home opener, he could easily win MVP honors at the end of the year.

#  Knicks falter against Hornets, time to reconsider your sports betting strategy?

In what could be seen as an upset to some, the Charlotte Hornets were able to take down the New York Knicks on their home court. The final score of the game was 106-101, with Dwight Howard putting up 21 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Hornets. Kemba Walker also had a strong game, scoring 26 points.

For New York, Tim Hardaway Jr. led the way with 34 points, but no other player scored over 20 points. Kristaps Porzingis had a particularly bad night, scoring only 11 points on 4-of-13 shooting.

This loss brings the Knicks' record to 16-21 on the season and 8th in the Eastern Conference. It's still early in the season, but it's looking increasingly likely that they will miss out on the playoffs for the fifth consecutive year.

For fans of sports betting, this presents a conundrum. On one hand, it might be tempting to write off the Knicks altogether and bet on other teams in their division (the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are currently leading the East). On the other hand, it's possible that this poor play is simply a blip and that they will start performing better soon.

How should you approach betting on the Knicks? The best strategy is probably to wait and see how they do in their next few games before making any decisions. If they continue to struggle, then it might be time to switch your allegiance to another team. However, if they manage to win a few games in a row, then it might be worth taking another look at them as potential contenders.

#  Carmelo Anthony leads Knicks to fourth straight victory, latest gambling odds reflect that

The New York Knicks managed to notch their fourth consecutive victory on Monday night against the Detroit Pistons, thanks in large part to Carmelo Anthony’s 36 points. The Knicks’ hot streak has coincided with a steady rise in their odds at winning the NBA championship.

Since starting the season at 40-1 to win it all, the Knicks’ championship odds have climbed to 14-1, making them the sixth most likely team to take home the trophy, according to online sportsbook Bovada.LV.

Only Oklahoma City (5-1), Miami (11-2), San Antonio (7-1), Los Angeles Clippers (8-1) and Denver (10-1) have better championship odds than New York.

Oddsmakers aren’t the only ones who have taken notice of the Knicks’ recent resurgence; fans have also been flocking back to Madison Square Garden. The team is currently averaging 19,357 fans per game, up from 18,047 last year.

The Knicks will look to extend their winning streak when they host Boston on Wednesday night.

#  Porzingis injured, how will the Knicks fare without their star player?

The New York Knicks are facing an uncertain future after Kristaps Porzingis was diagnosed with a torn ACL on Tuesday. The 22-year-old Porzingis is the team’s best player and was having his best season yet, averaging 22.7 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.

Without Porzingis, the Knicks will have to rely on their other players to step up. Carmelo Anthony is the team’s second-leading scorer, but he is not a good fit for head coach Jeff Hornacek’s offense. Rookie point guard Frank Ntilikina has shown promise but is still learning the NBA game.

The Knicks are in danger of missing the playoffs for the fourth straight year. They currently sit in 11th place in the Eastern Conference, four games behind the eighth-place Miami Heat. Even if they make the playoffs, they would likely be no match for top teams like the Boston Celtics or Cleveland Cavaliers.

Porzingis’ injury is a huge blow to the Knicks, but they will have to find a way to move on without him
