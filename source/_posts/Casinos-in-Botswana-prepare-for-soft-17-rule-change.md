#  Casinos in Botswana prepare for soft 17 rule change

The Gambling Board of Botswana has announced a change to the casino rules that will see soft 17 become a push instead of a loss. The change will come into effect on 1 January 2019.

The new rule means that when the player’s first two cards are an ace and six, or an ace and any other number lower than seven, the dealer will not win if they then draw another card. Instead, the result will be a push, which means players will neither win nor lose their bet.

According to the Gambling Board, the change was made to “ensure fairness and consistency in how outcomes are determined”. It is hoped that the new rule will make the game more exciting for players.

Casinos in Botswana have been preparing for the change for some time, and it is likely that the vast majority of them will be ready to go by 1 January 2019.

#  What impact will the soft 17 rule change have on Botswana's casinos?

The soft 17 rule change that was recently announced by the Botswana Gambling Board will have a significant impact on the country's casinos. The rule, which previously allowed casinos to offer reduced payouts for blackjack hands that consisted of a soft 17 (an Ace and a six), will now only allow payouts for hands that consist of an Ace and an eight or higher.

This change is expected to have a major impact on the country's casino industry, as it will reduce the chances of players winning lower-value hands. In fact, it has been estimated that the new rule could result in a 15% decrease in profits for Botswana's casinos.

 While the new rule is not ideal for the country's casinos, it is important to note that it is in line with global standards. In fact, most other countries around the world also do not allow payouts for blackjack hands consisting of a soft 17. This change will make Botswana's casinos more competitive and attractive for international players.

#  How will botswanan casinos adjust to the soft 17 rule change?

In early 2019, the Botswanan government announced a series of regulatory changes that will be implemented in the country’s gambling industry. This included a change to the soft 17 rule, which will now require dealers to stand on all 17s.

The soft 17 rule is a casino game convention that allows dealers to hit on a hand of 17 (soft) but to stand on all 18s. It exists primarily to give players an increased chance of winning without increasing the house edge too much.

The new rule in Botswana will bring the country in line with most other jurisdictions around the world, where dealers are generally required to stand on all 17s. The government says that the change is being made in order to protect consumers and ensure that casinos are operated fairly and in accordance with international best practice.

The announcement has caused some concern among casino operators in Botswana, who worry that it may negatively impact business. Some have raised concerns that players may be less inclined to gamble if they feel they are not at an advantage. Others have pointed out that the change could lead to increased volatility as players adjust their betting strategies.

Despite these concerns, it seems likely that the new rule will be implemented as planned. In light of this, casino operators in Botswana need to start preparing for the change now. This includes reviewing their rules and procedures to ensure that they are compliant with the new regulations. They should also consider how best to communicate the change to customers so that there is minimal disruption to business.
