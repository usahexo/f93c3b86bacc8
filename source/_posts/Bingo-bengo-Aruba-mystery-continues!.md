The Aruba mystery continues! Last month, we reported that a woman had been found dead on the beach in Aruba with no identification and few clues as to her identity. Now, police have announced that they have identified the woman as 57-year-old Shirley Ann Jackson of Michigan.

Jackson was last seen alive on November 18 when she left her home in Pontiac, Michigan. Her body was discovered on December 8 by a group of tourists walking along the beach in Aruba. Authorities believe that she died as a result of natural causes.

While authorities have not released a cause of death, an autopsy is scheduled for next week to confirm their preliminary findings.
