#  Why do some people believe that bitcasino is a scam? 

There are a few reasons why some people believe that bitcasino is a scam. The first reason is that bitcasino has been known to shut down suddenly without warning, taking player funds with them. This has caused a lot of players to lose money that they had deposited on the site. 

Another reason why some people believe that bitcasino is a scam is because there have been allegations that the site manipulates their games in order to give themselves an advantage over players. This means that players are not always able to win money on the site, which makes it seem like a scam. 

Finally, there have been complaints from players about how bitcasino does not always payout the winnings that they are owed. This can be very frustrating for players who have won money on the site, as they may not be able to get their money back. 

All of these reasons together make it understandable why some people might believe that bitcasino is a scam. However, it is important to remember that not all of these allegations have been proven and bitcasino has also denied all wrongdoing. So, it is up to each individual player to decide whether they believe the site is legitimate or not.
