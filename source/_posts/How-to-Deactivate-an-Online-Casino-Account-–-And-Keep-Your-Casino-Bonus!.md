# How to Disable an Online Casino Account and still keep your casino bonus 

Gamblers who have found themselves no longer interested in playing at an online casino often want to know how to disable their account and still keep their casino bonus. Fortunately, this is possible, but there are a few things you’ll need to do in order to make the process go as smoothly as possible. 

First and foremost, be sure that you have met any bonus wagering requirements before disabling your account. This is important, because if you don’t meet the requirements, you may lose the bonus altogether. In most cases, you will have to wager the bonus amount a certain number of times before it becomes eligible for withdrawal. 

If you have determined that you no longer wish to play at the online casino and would like to disable your account, contact customer support and request that your account be closed. Keep in mind that some casinos may require a waiting period of up to 72 hours before they can close an account, so be patient if this is the case. In some instances, you may also be required to provide proof of identity before your account can be closed. 

Once your account has been closed, any remaining funds will be transferred back to the method of deposit used when opening the account. If there are any issues with this process, contact customer support for assistance. As long as you have met all of the necessary requirements, your casino bonus should still be available for withdrawal once your account has been closed.

#  How to cancel your online casino account and still keep your casino bonus

If you've decided that you're no longer interested in playing at an online casino, the last thing you want to do is forfeit the bonus you've been given just for signing up. Fortunately, there are a few ways to cancel your account without losing the bonus.

 One way is to contact customer support and ask them to close your account. Most casinos will only require that you provide your username and/or email address in order to cancel your account. However, some casinos may require you to provide additional information or documentation before they will process your cancellation request.

Another way to cancel your account without forfeiting your bonus is to simply not place any more bets. Most casinos will consider your account cancelled if you haven't placed any bets within a certain period of time (usually 7-14 days). If you choose this method, be sure to cash out any remaining funds in your account beforehand.

Whichever method you choose, be sure to read the terms and conditions of the casino's cancellation policy before requesting cancellation. This will help ensure that you don't accidentally forfeit any of your bonus money.
