## Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One, is a comparing card game between usually several players and a dealer, where each player tries to achieve a total of 21 points without going over, and with the aim of having the higher score than the dealer. The game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards.

Plato is an artificial intelligence (AI) developed by Cambridge University which can be used to calculate the best move in blackjack. The AI has been designed using machine learning algorithms which enable it to learn from experience and improve its performance over time.

To use Plato, you first need to load it into your chosen blackjack game. Once loaded, you can then select the 'play' button and watch Plato take on the dealer. The AI will make moves for both itself and the dealer, including splitting and doubling down where applicable. You can also see how well Plato is performing by viewing the statistics table at the bottom of the screen.

Although playing against an AI may not be as much fun as playing against other players, it does have its advantages. For example, you can take your time to consider your next move without having to worry about others playing quickly. In addition, you can use Plato to help you improve your own blackjack skills – something that would be difficult to do when playing against other people.

So why not give Plato a go and see how well you can do against the dealer?
