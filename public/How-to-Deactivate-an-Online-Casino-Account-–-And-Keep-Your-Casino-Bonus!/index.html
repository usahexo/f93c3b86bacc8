In this article, we’ll show you how to deactivate your account and keep your bonus.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is find the deactivation link on the casino website. Once you’ve located it, click on the link and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>In most cases, you’ll be asked to provide some personal information such as your username and password. After submitting this information, your account will be deactivated and you’ll receive confirmation via email.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that some casinos require you to contact customer support in order to deactivate your account. If this is the case, simply contact customer support and provide them with the necessary details.</p>
<p>Once your account has been deactivated, all of your personal information will be removed from the casino database. As a result, you won’t be able to reactivate your account even if you change your mind later on.</p>
<p>That being said, if you decide to play at another online casino, don’t forget to create a new account and claim your bonus!</p>

Follow these simple steps to cancel your account and keep your bonus:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Log into your account and go to the “My Accounts” page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the “Cancel Account” link and follow the instructions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Send an email to customer support with the subject line “Cancelling My Account” and include your username and the date you’d like the account cancelled.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy the following text into the body of your email:</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Disable-an-Online-Casino-Account-and-still-keep-your-casino-bonus"><a href="#How-to-Disable-an-Online-Casino-Account-and-still-keep-your-casino-bonus" class="headerlink" title="How to Disable an Online Casino Account and still keep your casino bonus"></a>How to Disable an Online Casino Account and still keep your casino bonus</h1><p>Gamblers who have found themselves no longer interested in playing at an online casino often want to know how to disable their account and still keep their casino bonus. Fortunately, this is possible, but there are a few things you’ll need to do in order to make the process go as smoothly as possible. </p>
<p>First and foremost, be sure that you have met any bonus wagering requirements before disabling your account. This is important, because if you don’t meet the requirements, you may lose the bonus altogether. In most cases, you will have to wager the bonus amount a certain number of times before it becomes eligible for withdrawal. </p>
<p>If you have determined that you no longer wish to play at the online casino and would like to disable your account, contact customer support and request that your account be closed. Keep in mind that some casinos may require a waiting period of up to 72 hours before they can close an account, so be patient if this is the case. In some instances, you may also be required to provide proof of identity before your account can be closed. </p>
<p>Once your account has been closed, any remaining funds will be transferred back to the method of deposit used when opening the account. If there are any issues with this process, contact customer support for assistance. As long as you have met all of the necessary requirements, your casino bonus should still be available for withdrawal once your account has been closed.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-deactivate-your-online-casino-account-and-still-keep-your-casino-bonus"><a href="#How-To-deactivate-your-online-casino-account-and-still-keep-your-casino-bonus" class="headerlink" title="How To deactivate your online casino account and still keep your casino bonus!"></a>How To deactivate your online casino account and still keep your casino bonus!</h1><p>If you have had enough of casino gambling and want to deactivate your casino account, there are a few things you need to do in order to keep your bonus.</p>
<p>First of all, it is important to know that most casino bonuses have wagering requirements, which means you need to playthrough the bonus amount a certain number of times before you can withdraw any winnings. So if you want to keep your bonus, make sure you are aware of the wagering requirements associated with it.</p>
<p>Once you have decided that you would like to deactivate your casino account, contact the customer service team and ask for help. In most cases, they will be happy to oblige and will process your request quickly. However, be aware that there may be some casinos that require you to make a formal written request.</p>
<p>In addition, when cancelling your account it is important to remember to delete any personal information stored with the casino. This includes emails, addresses and even passwords. If you don’t delete this information, it could lead to identity theft or other security breaches down the road.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to deactivate your casino account but still want to keep your bonus, follow these simple steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Contact the customer service team and ask for help </li>
<li>Make sure you delete all personal information </li>
<li>Read through the wagering requirements carefully</li>
</ol>

Fortunately, there are a few ways to cancel your account without losing the bonus.</p>
<p> One way is to contact customer support and ask them to close your account. Most casinos will only require that you provide your username and&#x2F;or email address in order to cancel your account. However, some casinos may require you to provide additional information or documentation before they will process your cancellation request.</p>
<p>Another way to cancel your account without forfeiting your bonus is to simply not place any more bets. Most casinos will consider your account cancelled if you haven’t placed any bets within a certain period of time (usually 7-14 days). If you choose this method, be sure to cash out any remaining funds in your account beforehand.</p>
<p>Whichever method you choose, be sure to read the terms and conditions of the casino’s cancellation policy before requesting cancellation. This will help ensure that you don’t accidentally forfeit any of your bonus money.</p>
