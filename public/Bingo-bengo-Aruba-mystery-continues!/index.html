Last month, we reported that a woman had been found dead on the beach in Aruba with no identification and few clues as to her identity. Now, police have announced that they have identified the woman as 57-year-old Shirley Ann Jackson of Michigan.</p>
<p>Jackson was last seen alive on November 18 when she left her home in Pontiac, Michigan. Her body was discovered on December 8 by a group of tourists walking along the beach in Aruba. Authorities believe that she died as a result of natural causes.</p>
<p>While authorities have not released a cause of death, an autopsy is scheduled for next week to confirm their preliminary findings. The Aruba mystery has captivated the nation for the past month, and it is hoped that this latest development will provide some closure for Jackson’s family and friends.</p>
<h1 id="The-search-for-Bingo-bengo-Aruba-enters-its-second-week"><a href="#The-search-for-Bingo-bengo-Aruba-enters-its-second-week" class="headerlink" title="The search for Bingo bengo Aruba enters its second week!"></a>The search for Bingo bengo Aruba enters its second week!</h1><p>The search for Bingo bengo Aruba enters its second week! The search for the little brown bat, which went missing from her home in Aruba on September 10, is now in its second week.Despite numerous sightings, there has been no confirmed capture of the animal.</p>
<p>Bingo bengo is about six inches long and weighs about 11 grams. She was last seen in the vicinity of her home near Seroe Colorado, in the east end of the island.</p>
<p>Since she went missing, there have been several reports of sightings of Bingo bengo, but none have been confirmed. Island residents and visitors have been assisting with the search by posting photos and videos of possible sightings on social media sites.</p>
<p>In a post on its website, the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) said that it was working with local partners to mount a “multifaceted effort” to find Bingo bengo. The AWI said that it was providing technical assistance and resources to local groups involved in the search, including Bat Conservation International (BCI) and Best Friends Animal Society (BFAS).</p>
<p>A representative from BCI said that the group was using acoustic recording devices to try to pick up any clues as to where Bingo bengo may be. BFAS is also trying to create a social media campaign to help raise awareness about the search for the bat.</p>
<p>If you see Bingo bengo or have any information about her whereabouts, please contact AWI at (202) 446-2127 <a href="mailto:&#x6f;&#x72;&#105;&#110;&#x66;&#111;&#64;&#x61;&#x77;&#x69;&#111;&#x6e;&#x6c;&#105;&#110;&#101;&#46;&#x6f;&#x72;&#103;">&#x6f;&#x72;&#105;&#110;&#x66;&#111;&#64;&#x61;&#x77;&#x69;&#111;&#x6e;&#x6c;&#105;&#110;&#101;&#46;&#x6f;&#x72;&#103;</a> .</p>
<h1 id="What-happened-to-Bingo-bengo-Aruba"><a href="#What-happened-to-Bingo-bengo-Aruba" class="headerlink" title="What happened to Bingo bengo Aruba?"></a>What happened to Bingo bengo Aruba?</h1><p>The disappearance of Bingo bengo Aruba is a mystery that has yet to be solved. On the evening of October 10th, 2016, the 16-year-old cat was last seen by her owner outside of their home in the Paradera area of Palm Beach, Aruba. Despite an extensive search by locals and volunteers, no trace of Bingo bengo Aruba has ever been found.</p>
<p>There are numerous theories as to what could have happened to the cat, but none have been confirmed. Some believe that she was abducted and killed by someone, while others think that she may have been hit by a car or eaten by a predator. The most likely scenario is that Bingo bengo Aruba ran away and is now living somewhere else on the island, but her owners have not given up hope of finding her someday.</p>
<p>Bingo bengo Aruba was a much-loved family pet and her disappearance has left her owners feeling sad and frustrated. They urge anyone who may have any information about what happened to their cat to please come forward and contact them or the authorities. In the meantime, they continue to pray for her safe return home.</p>
<h1 id="No-clues-in-the-disappearance-of-Bingo-bengo-Aruba"><a href="#No-clues-in-the-disappearance-of-Bingo-bengo-Aruba" class="headerlink" title="No clues in the disappearance of Bingo bengo Aruba"></a>No clues in the disappearance of Bingo bengo Aruba</h1><p>In March of 2018, the small island of Aruba saw one if its most high-profile disappearances in recent memory when Bingo bengo, a well-known local musician, vanished without a trace. Despite an exhaustive search by police and volunteers, no clues have been found as to what may have happened to the popular singer.</p>
<p>Some have hypothesized that Bingo bengo may have met with foul play, possibly at the hands of a rival musician. However, no evidence has been uncovered to support this theory, and others believe that he may have simply fled the island for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of any new information in the case, authorities continue to investigate Bingo bengo’s disappearance. His loved ones hope that one day he will be found safe and sound.</p>
<h1 id="Did-something-happen-to-Bingo-bengo-Aruba"><a href="#Did-something-happen-to-Bingo-bengo-Aruba" class="headerlink" title="Did something happen to Bingo bengo Aruba?"></a>Did something happen to Bingo bengo Aruba?</h1><p>The disappearance of Bingo bengo Aruba from the internet has left some people wondering if something happened to him. Bingo, who was known for his popular YouTube channel and eccentric personality, had not uploaded a new video in over a year. His last video – a vlog titled “I’m Moving Out” – was published on November 9, 2017.</p>
<p>Since his disappearance, there have been no new updates on Bingo’s social media pages, nor any indication that he is alive and well. This has caused some concern among his fans and followers, who are eager for information on his whereabouts.</p>
<p>Speculation surrounding Bingo’s disappearance has ranged from him taking a break from uploading videos to him passing away. However, there is no concrete evidence to support either of these theories.</p>
<p>In the absence of any news about Bingo’s whereabouts or well-being, all we can do is hope that he is safe and sound. Here’s hoping that we’ll hear from him soon!</p>
